# Project-Data-Cleaning-of-Survey-Data
This project focuses on cleaning survey data obtained in a disorganized state. The initial dataset, named `Data - Survey File`, required some cleaning due to inconsistent formatting and redundant information. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Data Acquisition:** Obtained the raw survey data (`Data - Survey File`), which was initially in a  inconsistent formatting and redundant headers.
2. **Initial Cleaning with Excel:** Utilized basic Excel commands to concatenate header rows and eliminate completely empty columns, resulting in the edited file `Data - Survey File Edited Version`.
3. **Cleaning with Python and its Libraries:** Leveraged Python and the Pandas library to perform  data cleaning tasks. This included handling missing values, standardizing formats, and ensuring data integrity. The Python script used for this phase is available in the notebook `Script1_Data_Manipulation in Survey File Edited Version`.
4. **Final Output:** The culmination of these efforts is the cleaned and standardized dataset, represented by `Survey File Final Output`. This file serves as the refined dataset ready for analysis and further processing.

**Tools Used:**

- Excel for initial data preprocessing
- Python (including Pandas) for  data manipulation
